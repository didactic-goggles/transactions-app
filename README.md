# transactions-app
 
This is a fullstack Node.Js application. For application prupose, I also attached a standalone version for Windows PC but if you have a problem to start this executable version, please consider this application as Node.Js application and run start command in package.json on client and server folders.

Server Folder = API files (Node.Js with Express and Typescript)
Client Folder = Frontend Application (React.Js with Bootstrap and TypeScript)
